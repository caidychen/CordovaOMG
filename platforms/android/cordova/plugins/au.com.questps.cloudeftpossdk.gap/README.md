# Cloud Eftpos Cordova Plugin

The Cloud Eftpos Cordova plugin supports iOS and Android and is in pre-release. 
Android support is limited to Android Studio and compiling using Eclipse or Cordova-CLI will fail.

## Setup

The plugin works out of the box for iOS but Android requires some manual steps.

### Android Studio Setup

After adding the plugin, ensure that the contents of android-extras/settings.gradle and android-extras/build-extras.gradle are included in the respective files of the generated project.
